The idea is that you leave "graffiti" at locations for others to discover.  "Graffiti" can be anything: short messages, pictures, drawings (future version), funny anecdotes.  Only the last few "graffiti" will be left at a specific location similar to how new graffiti covers up old graffiti on a real wall.  You can leave "graffiti" in all sorts of locations such as in a bathroom (to solve the problem of having to clean the toilet stalls), in a classroom during a lecture (leave comments about how cold the room is or how boring the lecturer is), at a famous landmark (post pictures of you "on top of" the leaning Tower of Pisa, etc.  People can leave funny, embarrassing moments of things that happened to them at a location to share with others who visit the location in the future.  You can leave time-capsules at your favorite oak tree for some future person to find.   The possibilities are endless for the experiences you can create with our app.
